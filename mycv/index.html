    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h4>Iron Mind Exoskeleton</h4>
    <p>The Iron Mind Exoskeleton is an innovative wearable robotic system designed to assist and enhance human physical
        movement. This semi-automated exoskeleton is intended primarily for individuals who face mobility challenges due
        to injury, age, or disability, as well as for workers in physically demanding environments. The suit functions
        by integrating motor-assisted joints and sensors that detect the user's movement intentions, providing support
        and strength to the limbs during motion. Built using lightweight materials and powered by servo motors, the
        system uses a microcontroller such as Arduino
        to process real-time data from motion sensors and control the actuators accordingly. The Iron Mind Exoskeleton
        aims to reduce muscle strain, improve mobility, and assist in rehabilitation for patients recovering from
        strokes or injuries. This project highlights the use of embedded systems, biomechanics, and control systems to
        create a functional
        and user-friendly wearable device. It has significant applications in medical rehabilitation, industrial safety,
        and defense. The prototype developed demonstrated successful assisted limb movement, earning recognition and a
        gold medal at the Talentronics Project Fest.</p>

    <p>Web Devlopment Intern</p>
    <h4>VTech Integrated solutions</h4>
    <p>During my internship at VTech Integrated Solutions Institute, I worked as a Web Development Intern, where I was
        involved in building and improving user-friendly web applications. My primary project, titled "Study Assistant",
        focused on creating an interactive platform to help students manage their academic schedules, notes, and
        reminders efficiently.Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for front-end
        development, and learned the basics of backend integration. I collaborated with a team to design responsive web
        pages, enhance UI/UX, and ensure smooth navigation across devices. This experience helped me strengthen my
        technical skills, understand real-world web development processes, and develop problem-solving abilities in a
        practical environment.</p>
